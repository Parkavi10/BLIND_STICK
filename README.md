# BLIND_STICK

This project is a navigation aid for visually impaired individuals, designed to detect obstacles and provide real-time feedback using sensors and Arduino. The stick uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance, triggering a buzzer and LED when objects are detected within a threshold range, ensuring safer movement indoors and outdoors.
