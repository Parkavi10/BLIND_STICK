# BLIND_STICK

This project is a navigation aid for visually impaired individuals, designed to detect obstacles and provide real-time feedback using sensors and Arduino. The stick uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance, triggering a buzzer and LED when objects are detected within a threshold range, ensuring safer movement indoors and outdoors.

Features:  
-1.Obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensor  
*2.Audible (buzzer) and visual (LED) alerts

-3.Simple Arduino-based code for easy deployment

-4.Can be extended with IoT features like GPS, Bluetooth earphones, and smartphone integration
